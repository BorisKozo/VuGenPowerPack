VuGenPowerPack
==============

This repository will contain all the Addins I am developing for VuGen

###Compilation Note
To compile the solution you must add *%LR_DIR%\bin* to the reference paths of all the projects.
There is a compiled version in the *VuGenPowerPack* directory in the root of the repository. If you 
don't want to compile yourself you can copy the content of this directory to *%LR_DIR%\addins\extra\VuGenPowerPack*.

##HttpXmlView

Adds some missing functionality to the XmlView inside the Http snapshot.

TBD
